# wacom-precision-mode

Precision mode tool for Wacom tablets on Linux.

## Installation

Install requirements:
- non-GUI mode only requires `pip install python-xlib`
- `--gui` requires `pip install PyQt6`

There's a `requirements.txt` that contains those packets.
Install them via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

You might want to install the packets into a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
... TODO: install requirements ...
```
